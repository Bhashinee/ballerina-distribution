# Service

This explains how the Ballerina WebSocket server interacts with a WebSocket client. Apart from the `onMessage` remote function given in the example, there are few other remote functions to receive different types of WebSocket messages. The `onOpen` remote function is dispatched as soon as the WebSocket handshake is completed and the connection is established, `onPing` and `onPong` remote methods are dispatched upon receiving ping and pong messages respectively, `onIdleTimeout` remote method is dispatched when the idle timeout is reached, `onClose` is dispatched when a close frame with a statusCode and a reason is received and `onError` is dispatched when an error occurs in the WebSocket connection.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`websocket` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/websocket/latest/).

>**Info:** You can invoke the above service via the [WebSocket client](/learn/by-example/websocket-client/).
