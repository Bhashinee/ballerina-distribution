# REST service - Basic

Ballerina supports writing RESTful services with its first-class service and resource concepts. The `accessor-name`, `service/resource name`, `data binding`, `path`, and `query` parameter support help to write meaningful APIs. The sample depicts the way of writing the `GET` and `POST` resources.

::: code http_basic_rest_service.bal :::

Run the service as follows.

::: out http_basic_rest_service.server.out :::

Invoke the service by executing the following cURL command in a new terminal.

::: out http_basic_rest_service.client.out :::

>**Tip:** You can invoke the above service via the [Send request/Receive response client](/learn/by-example/http-client-send-request-receive-response/).
