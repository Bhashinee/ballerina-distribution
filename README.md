## About Ballerina

Ballerina makes it easy to write microservices that integrate APIs.

#### Integration Syntax
A compiled, transactional, statically and strongly typed programming language with textual and graphical syntaxes. Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration and offers a type safe, concurrent environment to implement microservices.

#### Networked Type System
A type system that embraces network payload variability with primitive, object, union, and tuple types.

#### Concurrency
An execution model composed of lightweight parallel worker units that are non-blocking where no function can lock an executing thread manifesting sequence concurrency.
